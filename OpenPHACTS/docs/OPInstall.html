<h3>Install your API keys</h3>

You will need an application ID and key to operate the OpenPHACTS API.  You can get your keys from the <a href="http://dev.openphacts.org">OpenPHACTS Developer Site</a>.  Click on "Get my API keys!" and follow the instructions. 

You can install your API keys in your SPARQLMotion installation by editing the file keys/PHACTS.key.ttl.  The relevant part of the file to edit is at the end:

<pre>
PHACTS:MyKey
      rdf:type keymodel:Key ;
      rdfs:label "My key"^^xsd:string ;
      keymodel:id "XXXXXXXX"^^xsd:string ;
      keymodel:key "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"^^xsd:string .
</pre>

Replace XXXXXXXX with your appliction ID and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your key.  In TopBraid Composer, refresh your project by right-clicing and selecting "Refresh".
<p/>
Your OpenPHACTS modules are now ready to use.
