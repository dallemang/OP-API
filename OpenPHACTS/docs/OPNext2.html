Type in "Sorafenib" when prompted, then "Infer result triples" and click, "Close".  As before, you can copy-and-paste from the OpenPHACTS documentation right into a SPARQL Query, e.g.:

SELECT *
WHERE {
?equiv_assay chembl:hasTarget ?equiv_target ;
}
</pre>
and see the targets associated with the assays in the results.
